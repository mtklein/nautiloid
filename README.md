# Nautiloid Adventure Vertical Slice

This repository contains a prototype for a 2D RPG inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger. The scenario resembles an escape from a nautiloid ship, with original characters and dialogues. The goal is to demonstrate core gameplay features in a small vertical slice.

See `docs/vertical_slice_design.md` for the design overview. Run `python3 src/main.py` to try the text-based demo.
