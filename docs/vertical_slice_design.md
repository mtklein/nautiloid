# Vertical Slice Design

This document outlines the scope for the prototype.

## Features

* **Character Creation:** Choose a name and class (Fighter, Rogue, Mage, Cleric).
* **Exploration:** Navigate multiple text-based rooms connected by doors.
* **Interactables:** Open chests and inspect objects to learn about the ship.
* **Familiar Companion:** Discover a strange creature that can join you after a simple skill check.
* **Melee Fighter Companion:** Rescue a warrior and engage in a short dialog when he joins.
* **Cleric Companion:** Meet a cleric who converses with you before helping reach the ship's control room.

The demo uses a simple text interface to focus on narrative flow and basic combat.

## Future Work

* Graphics and tile-based movement (potentially using Pygame or Godot).
* More complex combat with abilities and inventory.
