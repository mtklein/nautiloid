# Vertical Slice Design

This document outlines the scope for the prototype.

## Features

* **Character Creation:** Choose a name and class (Fighter, Rogue, Mage).
* **Exploration:** Navigate text-based rooms representing a nautiloid ship.
* **Familiar Companion:** Discover a strange creature that can join you after a simple skill check.
* **Melee Fighter Companion:** Rescue a warrior and battle imps together.
* **Cleric Companion:** Meet a cleric who helps reach the ship's control room before it crashes.

The demo uses a simple text interface to focus on narrative flow and basic combat.

## Future Work

* Graphics and tile-based movement (potentially using Pygame or Godot).
* More complex combat with abilities and inventory.
